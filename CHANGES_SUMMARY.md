   - If found, user is automatically logged in to Dashboard
   - If not found, user is directed to LoginScreen

#### 2. **Email-Based User Recognition**

   - Email is stored locally (no server needed)
   - If email is registered, the user can log in with the same email

#### 3. **Logout Functionality**

   - Initializes SharedPreferences on app startup
   - Stores user data: email and name
   - On every login: email and name are saved to device
   - On logout: all user data is cleared

### Database/Storage Implementation Details

**Technology Used:** `shared_preferences` (Flutter local storage)

**Stored Data:**
- `lastEmail`: User's email address (used for auto-login)
- `lastUserName`: User's full name (used for profile display)

**Flow:**
```
Sign Up → Store Email & Name → Auto-login on next app open
  ↓
  └→ Logout → Clear Data → Redirect to LoginScreen
  
Login → Store Email & Name → Auto-login on next app open
  ↓
  └→ Logout → Clear Data → Redirect to LoginScreen
```
